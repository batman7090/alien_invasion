## About

**Alien Invasion** is a classic arcade-style shooter game where you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, firing bullets to destroy descending aliens.  
This project is built using Pygame, which makes it easier to manage graphics, animation, and sound, allowing me to focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.

This repository is intended as a learning project, exploring the basics of game loops, collision detection, event handling, and simple UI.

- Move your spaceship left and right
